# A JavaScript Tic Tac Toe Game

## This is an exercise from The Odin Project's full stack JavaScript curriculum.

The purpose of this exercise is to

* Understand and gain experience in working with factory functions
* Gain further understanding of scope and closure
* Gain experience using inheritance in objects using the factory pattern
* Get introduced to IIFEs

Major take home message: Not every function needs to be accessible by the entire program. Creating private functions and encapsulating logic creates an environment that is easier to refactor and test, and harder to screw with.
